v26

## Changes

* Fix loading of `nixConfig` from `flake.nix`. If you had no `flake.nix` file in your repository, you would get an error when using `nix-quick-install-action`. This was reported in [#35](https://github.com/nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action/issues/35).

* Bump minor Nix versions: 2.13.3 -> 2.13.6, 2.15.1 -> 2.15.3, 2.16.1 -> 2.16.2

* Bump default Nix version: 2.16.1 -> 2.16.2
